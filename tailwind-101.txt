Tailwind CSS

What is a CSS preprocessor ?  A pre processor is a tool that is used to enhance the features of CSS by introducing features that are not part of the CSS spec.
They then process these styles to output standard CSS that the browsers understand.

What is POST CSS ?

Post CSS is not a CSS pre processor.
PostCSS transforms the existing CSS using various plugins. These plugins can perform tasks such as adding vendor prefixes, linting, minification, and more. 
The transformation occurs after the original CSS has been written, hence the term "post."

Unlike traditional preprocessors that introduce a new syntax (like Sass or Less), PostCSS doesn't have its own syntax.

It's a post-processor because it comes into play after the initial CSS has been authored, whether manually or using a preprocessor like Sass, Less, or Stylus.
